    Transforming Quality Engineering with GenAI-powered tools that validate, refine, 
    and auto-generate — accelerating delivery while raising the bar on quality.

    Bringing GenAI into the heart of Quality Engineering to boost speed, precision, and impact.
    We're building smart solutions like:

    🔍 User Story Assessor – Instantly flags gaps in clarity, coverage, and testability

    ✍️ User Story Refiner – Sharpens messy stories into dev-ready requirements

    ⚙️ Test Case Generator – Auto-generates test cases with context-aware intelligence

    The result? 
    
    Faster cycles, fewer bugs, and a smarter path to quality.
